    <p>This is a movie rating app built to practice for a technical interview. It uses a Ruby on Rails backend that calls from a movie API hosted on RapidAPIs. Movies are added to the database by searching the API by title and clicking on a movie instance. You are then pushed to the movies show page where you can thumbs up or down a movie. The home page displays all the movies that have been added to the database ordered by thumbs ups.</p>
